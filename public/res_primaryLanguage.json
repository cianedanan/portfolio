      "description": "👋 Hi, I’m Cianenry Danan. I’m a junior software developer looking to begin my professional career in the tech industry. Before I decided to change career paths I was working in the aerospace manufacturing industry. My main titles included CNC Machine Operator 2 and Hot Draper, but I was cross trained to learn many other roles including lay-up and tool-prep. I decided to learn Software Development, because I’ve always loved technology and I’ve always loved problem solving. I built my first PC in 2016 and since then I’ve been building custom PC’s and troubleshooting for my friends and family as a hobby. For me it’s such a good feeling fitting together individual pieces and seeing them run as a whole. Software development is like PC building except better because you get to create those individual pieces. I want to work for a fast growing tech company that’ll allow me to make an impact with my problem solving skills and my ability to work well in a team.",
