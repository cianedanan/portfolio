      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cianenry Danan. Iâ€™m a junior software developer looking to begin my professional career in the tech industry. Before I decided to change career paths I was working in the aerospace manufacturing industry. My main titles included CNC Machine Operator 2 and Hot Draper, but I was cross trained to learn many other roles including lay-up and tool-prep. I decided to learn Software Development, because Iâ€™ve always loved technology and Iâ€™ve always loved problem solving. I built my first PC in 2016 and since then Iâ€™ve been building custom PCâ€™s and troubleshooting for my friends and family as a hobby. For me itâ€™s such a good feeling fitting together individual pieces and seeing them run as a whole. Software development is like PC building except better because you get to create those individual pieces. I want to work for a fast growing tech company thatâ€™ll allow me to make an impact with my problem solving skills and my ability to work well in a team.",
